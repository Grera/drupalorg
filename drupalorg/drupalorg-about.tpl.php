    <h2>Drupal's History</h2>
    <p><a href="http://buytaert.net/">Dries Buytaert</a> began the Drupal software as an message board in 1999. Within a year or so, more people became interested using and contributing to Drupal, so the project was made open source. Drupal.org came online in 2001, and the Drupal community gained momentum in 2005 with several code sprints and conferences.
