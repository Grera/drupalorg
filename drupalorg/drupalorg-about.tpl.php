      <h3 id="aboutpersonalisation"><a href="/features/build">BUILD</a></h3>
      <p>Build internal and external-facing websites in a matter of hours, with no custom programming. No need to start from scratch every time you build a new site, either. You can utilize a multi-site configuration or choose a Drupal distribution (installation profile). These provide a pre-defined configuration of site features and functions for a specific purpose or type of site, available as a single download.</p>

    <div class="grid-3">
      <h3 id="aboutwebbased"><a href="/features/create">CREATE</a></h3>      
      <p>Manage content with an easy-to-use web interface. Drupal's flexibility handles countless content types including video, text, blog, podcasts, and polls with robust user management, menu handling, real-time statistics and optional revision control.</p>

    <div class="grid-3">
      <h3 id="aboutsearching"><a href="/features/administer">ADMINISTER</a></h3>
      <p>Drupal comes with great options for new user accounts and user permissions. Users can be assigned one or more roles, and each role can be set up with fine-grained permissions allowing users view and create only what the administrator permits. The Drupal 7 admin theme makes administering a site easier than ever.</p>

    <div class="grid-3 omega">
      <h3 id="aboutthemes"><a href="/features/design">DESIGN AND DISPLAY</a></h3>
      <p>Drupal's presentation layer allows designers to create highly usable, interactive experiences that engage users and increase traffic. Use an existing Drupal theme for your site, giving it an instant identity! If you can't find one you like, try designing your own which others can use, too.</p>

    </div>
      
    <div class="grid-3">
      <h3 id="aboutmodules"><a href="/features/extend">EXTEND</a></h3>
      <p>With more than 6000 available modules, the vast majority of your site's requirements can be addressed with Drupal core and available add-on modules.
